# Contributor Code of Conduct

As maintainers and contributors of the **galigo** project, we pledge to make participation in our community a respectful, harassment-free experience for everyone — regardless of level of experience, identity, or background.

We are building an open-source Telegram library that prioritizes stability, safety, and thoughtful collaboration. That only works if everyone feels safe contributing.
